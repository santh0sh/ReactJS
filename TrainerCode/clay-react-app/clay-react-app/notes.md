Clay CSS for UI/UX with React:
==============================
https://clayui.com/docs/components/

Clay is built on bootstrap with lexicon language interface.

Clay makes the components and CSS available in its own @clayui scope
Atlas.css is the  theme for generic styles. 


In some packages we expose multiple components, for example the @clayui/form package contains components Checkbox, Radio, Input, Select...

@clayui/core contains components like <text> ....

npm install @clayui/css 
or
yarn add @clayui/css 

for working with clay components , we need to install corresponding
package. Example : yarn add @clayui/button
