Portals are defined as 
“a first-class way to render children into a DOM node 
that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component”. 

This becomes useful for rendering things like 
tooltips, modals, chat widgets and other components 
that might need to overflow from the root component.


in index.html of public folder , add mount point.
i.e.  <div id="portal"/> to hold the portal.

Create PageOne,PageTwo and PageThree
for routing.

add css in index.css


Open MusicPlayer.js and see the code.
This will be child component rendered on portal.
Here render method returns ReactDOM.renderPortal().

Open index.js which brings everything together.
Main.js component  contains main application in BrowserRouter
and MusicComponent rendered outside BrowserRouter.

Here we created a changing state variable time and we 
pass it to the MusicPlayer child component as a prop, 
if you run the application you will notice that the 
changes in the state are reflected in the portal component.
